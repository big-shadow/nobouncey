# NoBouncey
### Your pre-import partner. Developed with LinkedIn in mind.

A bash + dot net core app to clean large CSV files containing email addresses, split them into chunked files and apply headers to all chucnks. Developed and tested with lists up to 250,000 entries long.

This program does NOT follow RCF email validation rule sets.
This uses built-in Micrsoft + arbitrary email validation rules.
